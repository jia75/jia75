    <h2>docm</h2>
    
    <p>The goal of the <em>docm</em> command line utility is to allow users to have an organized collection of documents. This means: document tagging, rules about documents, document grouping, and probably more. To figure out what else could or should be included it is important or rather useful to imagine a use scenario.</p>
    <p>Such a scenario could resemble an organization trying to collect its documentation on a specific project. The goal of <em>docm</em> is to facilitate the usage of the documentation collection, and to also facilitate the creation and addition of new documentation.</p>
    <p><em>docm</em> recommends a workflow with stages: for example, a new piece of documentation could go from a draft, to a working paper, to a deliberated document and finally get accepted and be active.</p>
